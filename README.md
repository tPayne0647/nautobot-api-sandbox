This is just a basic program for me to play around with Nautobot Demo API

To install-
* cd to the directory of this project
*  type 'pip install .' in terminal and press enter


to run program-
* type 'nautobot_api_sandbox' in terminal and press enter
* a welcome menu will appear with available commands. 
* type in desired command and press enter. NOTE- you don't need to add '()' or "". just simply type the command and the name 

for help-
* type help and press enter

to exit-
* type 'exit' and press enter

This is a work in progress!!!

Next I would like to incorporate classes. If you have any tips or suggestions, feel free to create a branch!
