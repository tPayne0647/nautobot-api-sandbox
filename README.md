This is just a basic program for me to play around with Nautobot Demo API (demo.nautobot.com)

To install-
* cd to the directory of this project
*  type 'pip install .' in terminal and press enter


to run program-
* type 'nautobot_api_sandbox' in terminal and press enter
* type in demo api token found at: demo.nautobot.com ('aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa'). 
* type in desired command and press enter. NOTE- you don't need to add '()' or "". just simply type the command and the name 

for help-
* type help and press enter

to exit-
* type 'exit' and press enter


-currently working on incorporating classes. Feel free to add anything.

This is a work in progress!!!
