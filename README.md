# Nautobot API Sandbox

This is a simple program to test my programming knowledge and learn more about API and Nautobot.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.9 or later
- Poetry

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:tPayne0647/nautobot-api-sandbox.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd nautobot-api-sandbox`
3. Install the project dependencies using Poetry: `poetry install`
4. Activate the virtual environment created by Poetry: `poetry shell`
5. Run the program: `nautobot_api_sandbox`

Demo token: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

   This will start the Nautobot API Sandbox command-line interface.
   Follow the instructions in the application to interact with the Nautobot API.
   NOTE: You don't need to add '()' or "" quotes. Simply type the command + the name (e.g., create_tenant tpayne, show_devices atl01).

## Development

If you're contributing to the project or want to run tests, make sure to install the development dependencies as well: `poetry install --dev`
To run the tests: `poetry run pytest`

Any help or tips would be awesome!

## Currently Working On / Want to Add

- Exception handling? Need to learn more about how these work exactly...
- Valid unittest?
- Integrate click?
- Make sure using logging correctly
- Poetry integration
- publish application?

This is a work in progress!!!
