This is just a basic program for me to play around with Nautobot Demo API (demo.nautobot.com)

To install-
* cd to the directory of this project (after cloning)
*  type 'pip install .' in terminal and press enter


to run program-
* type 'nautobot_api_sandbox' in terminal and press enter
* copy and paste demo api token: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa (demo nautobot user token)
* type in desired command and press enter. NOTE- you don't need to add '()' or "". just simply type the command + the name (eg. create_tenant tpayne, show_devices atl01)

for help-
* type help and press enter

to exit-
* type 'exit' and press enter


-currently working on/ want to add
* exception handling?

This is a work in progress!!!
